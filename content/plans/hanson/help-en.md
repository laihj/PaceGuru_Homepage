# Hanson Marathon Method Guide

## What is Hanson Marathon Method?

Hanson's Marathon Method is a scientific marathon training system developed by the Hanson brothers, emphasizing **cumulative fatigue** and **specific endurance training**.

## How to Use This Calculator

### 1. Enter Target Marathon Time
- Input your target marathon finish time at the top of the table, and the system will automatically calculate various training paces and jump to the specific training schedule interface
- In the training schedule interface, you can choose between beginner or advanced plans, then set your own warm-up and cool-down times
- If you have a specific race date, you can input it, and the system will automatically add specific dates to each training session
- At the bottom of the page, you can download the plan as a PDF file for printing and use.

### 2. Understanding Pace Table

The table displays these training paces:

- **Marathon Pace (MP)**: Your planned race pace
- **Easy Pace**: Comfortable recovery running pace
- **Long Run Pace**: Long distance training pace
- **Tempo Pace**: Lactate threshold training pace
- **Interval Pace**: High-intensity interval training pace
- **Repetition Pace**: Short distance speed training pace

## Training Plan Structure

Hanson method includes 6 core training types:

### Easy Runs
- **Purpose**: Build aerobic base, promote recovery
- **Feel**: Comfortable conversational pace
- **Frequency**: 2-3 times per week

### Long Runs
- **Purpose**: Build endurance, simulate race fatigue
- **Distance**: 16-22km (10-14 miles)
- **Pace**: 30-45 seconds per km slower than marathon pace

### Tempo Runs
- **Purpose**: Improve lactate threshold
- **Distance**: 8-12km (5-8 miles)
- **Pace**: Marathon pace or slightly faster

### Interval Training
- **Purpose**: Improve aerobic capacity and speed
- **Structure**: 800m-1600m repeats
- **Pace**: 15-30 seconds per km faster than marathon pace

### Strength Runs
- **Purpose**: Build muscular endurance
- **Structure**: 6-10 miles at marathon pace
- **Focus**: Simulate late-race fatigue

### Repetition Runs
- **Purpose**: Improve running efficiency and speed
- **Structure**: 400-800m short, fast repeats
- **Pace**: Faster than interval pace

## Weekly Training Structure

| Day | Training |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Rest or cross-training |
| Tuesday | Interval training |
| Wednesday | Easy run |
| Thursday | Tempo or strength run |
| Friday | Easy run |
| Saturday | Tempo or interval training |
| Sunday | Long run |

## Key Principles

### Cumulative Fatigue
- Accumulate fatigue through consecutive days of training
- Simulate late-race body conditions
- Avoid overexertion in single workouts

### Specificity Principle
- Training pace and distance should match race requirements
- Long runs don't need to be excessively long (16-22km is sufficient)
- Focus on training quality over quantity

### Progressive Overload
- Increase weekly mileage by no more than 10%
- Schedule a recovery week every 3-4 weeks
- Adjust intensity based on body response

## Common Questions

### Q: Is Hanson Method suitable for beginners?
Suitable for runners with some running background. Recommend starting after being able to run continuously for 30 minutes.

### Q: Why are long runs only 22km?
Hanson method emphasizes cumulative fatigue. With 6 days of prior training, the body is already fatigued during long runs, making 22km equivalent to traditional 32km training effect.

### Q: How to adjust pace?
If target pace feels too difficult, reduce target time and recalculate paces. Better to be conservative than overtrain.

### Q: What if I miss a workout?
Don't make up missed workouts. Continue with the original plan. If missing 3+ consecutive days, consider restarting that week.

## Race Strategy

### Pace Distribution
- **First 5km**: 5-10 seconds per km slower than target pace
- **5-35km**: Run at planned pace
- **Final 7km**: Can increase pace based on feel

### Fueling Strategy
- Water every 5km
- Energy gel every 10km

## Important Notes

> ⚠️ **Important Reminders**
> - Warm up before training, stretch after
> - Listen to your body, adjust for injuries
> - Ensure adequate sleep and nutrition
> - Regular medical check-ups
