In recent iOS and Apple Watch versions, Apple introduced a new training data feature: training step names. Previously, training steps only had typesâ€”warm-up, training, recovery, cool-down. Now you can add any custom name you want, such as "one-minute sprint" or "comfortable pace".

These names will also be visible when using your watch during training.

In PaceGuru 1.7.3, we've added support for this new feature. When editing your training, you can add custom names for each step, and we'll display them in the interface.
