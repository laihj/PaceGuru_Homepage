In PaceGuru's running detail sharing, there are three features: share running image, share card, and share data. The running image and card are for humans to see. But the running data is just dense lines of characters — who is it for?

## It's for AI

This feature has existed for a long time. Later, in one version, I integrated Deepseek into the app to analyze running records. I thought it would be more convenient to directly provide users with a conclusion, so I removed it.

But a user sent me a message saying they hoped to keep this feature because they wanted to share it with their favorite AI.

I think they're right. AI is developing so rapidly now — domestically there's Doubao, Deepseek, Qianwen, and internationally there's ChatGPT, Gemini, and more. All are excellent models. Plus, everyone develops their own rapport through chatting with these models. Some models can even remember user preferences. So I restored this feature, allowing users to chat with their own models about their running, just like talking with a running coach who understands their running situation.

I personally use Gemini the most.

After every run, I save the text and send it to a specific Gemini chat, asking Gemini to help summarize it. I also have it do weekly and monthly summaries.

It's like having a coach. Sometimes I tell it my muscles feel tight and running feels uncomfortable, and it can suggest relaxation exercises.

I think in the AI era, every logging app should have a plain text export feature. Let users work with their own AI assistants to gain more valuable insights from daily records.

Attached is Gemini's summary of my training week:

> ### 1. Training Week Review and Intensity Distribution
>
> - **Sunday (01-04)**: Base recovery run (5.31 km, pace 5'47", HR 135 bpm)
> - **Monday (01-05)**: Aerobic run + 5 sprints (12.01 km, avg HR 136 bpm)
> - **Tuesday (01-06)**: Core intensity session — interval training (12.03 km, including 5 sets of 1.2 km fast runs, pace under 4'50")
> - **Wednesday (01-07)**: Rest day
> - **Thursday (01-08)**: Aerobic run + 5 sprints (10.18 km, pace 5'40")
> - **Friday (01-09)**: Easy recovery run (7.55 km, pace 5'43")
> - **Saturday (01-10)**: LSD long distance (based on previous records, this is the highest volume session of the week)
>
> ### 2. Plan Strengths
>
> **Very Professional Structure**: You follow a typical "short at both ends, intense in middle, long on weekend" training pattern. There are interval runs (Tuesday) to improve cardio upper limit, sprints (Monday/Thursday) to optimize neuromuscular ability, and LSD to consolidate aerobic base.
>
> **Excellent Heart Rate Zone Control**: In most aerobic runs, your heart rate stabilizes in Z1/Z2 zones (like 135-139 bpm), showing your aerobic base is solid, and training intensity distribution follows the 80/20 rule (80% low intensity, 20% high intensity).
>
> **Good Ground Contact Time**: Your ground contact time during intervals (228ms) is noticeably shorter than during easy runs (252ms), reflecting good elasticity at high speeds.
>
> ### 3. Improvement Suggestions
>
> **Increase Cadence During Easy Runs**: In Sunday and Friday easy runs, your cadence is around 172-176. Try to increase and stabilize cadence around 180 steps/min even during easy runs. Higher cadence with smaller stride can further reduce knee joint stress during long distances (especially LSD).
>
> **Add Core and Strength Training**: Records show this week was all running. Tuesday intervals and Saturday LSD put significant muscle stress. Consider adding 15 minutes of single-leg stability exercises (like Bulgarian split squats) or core strength training after Thursday aerobic run or on Wednesday rest day to prevent injuries from increased mileage.
>
> **Post-LSD Recovery**: Since you just completed LSD, this Sunday (01-11)建议 complete rest or only very low-intensity walking, allowing muscle fibers full repair to avoid cumulative fatigue entering next week.
>
> **Environmental Adaptation**: Records show training temperature between 14°C to 20°C. If future race environment is colder, try thinner gear during Thursday aerobic runs to adapt to perceived temperature in advance.
>
> **Summary**: This is a very high-quality training week with reasonable pace distribution and excellent execution of key intensity sessions. Just maintain current rhythm, fine-tune cadence, and add some strength cross-training, and progress will be very steady!
