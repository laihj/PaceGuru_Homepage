Generally, after running consistently for a period of time, people often want to improve their abilities.

They'll watch videos and read books to find methods.

Then they'll encounter terms like aerobic runs, threshold runs, and interval training, learning about individual running abilities such as lactate buffering capacity and speed capabilities.

They'll also discover that training these abilities requires targeted training—running specific distances or times at specific paces.

PaceGuru itself has the functionality to create plans and sync them to Apple Watch. This time we've gone further—you can conveniently use our built-in templates.
