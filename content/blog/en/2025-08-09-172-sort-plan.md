This version mainly updates two features, one operational and one visual.

First, we now support reordering training plan content. For example, if you create a pyramid plan 1km - 2km - 3km - 2km - 1km, but accidentally miss the 3km section, you can now create a 3km segment and move it to the middle. Or if you upgrade your pyramid to 1234321, you can now easily do this.

This is a feature we wanted to build from day one, and today it's finally completed.

The second is visual - in the running list interface, we've now added the running route as an icon on the left side.

Both features were completed at the estuary of Minjiang River in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, in collaboration with kiro and Claude.
