In PaceGuru, we've always provided a 30-day running volume view, while also calculating the proportion of each zone for all runs during these thirty days.

One day I had an idea: since I set a target for 30-day volume, why not set targets for each zone? This way we can control running volume structure based on different training goals—using sufficient aerobic running to maintain aerobic capacity, muscle and cardiovascular system health, while combining different proportions of other paces to maintain adequate stimulus for lactate buffering and speed capabilities. At the same time, based on preset volume limits, we can prevent overtraining in high-intensity zones and prevent injuries.

For UI design, since five pace zones plus total running volume targets make exactly six items, I designed a hexagonal chart. Using training to fill the hexagon as much as possible represents making progress toward goals through dedicated training while staying healthy.

And this icon is placed on the first screen of the home page—visible immediately upon opening the app.

To view more detailed information, clicking the hexagon on the home page expands to show more detailed data, allowing you to see the specific completion percentage for each item. It's recommended to fill other planned zones systematically while ensuring aerobic running volume.

Thirty days is about four weeks. I plan to distribute these high-intensity running volumes in weekly training. Using the image above as an example, running 7km at marathon pace per week is relatively simple—one training session will suffice.

For 6km of threshold running, if done in one session, it's typically 800-1600m intervals—about five threshold training sets.

For 4km of anaerobic intervals stimulating VO2 max, using 400m intervals would be 10 rounds.

Below this page, we provide customization functionality with preset ratios for beginner, intermediate, and elite levels. The basic principle is that the more novice the runner, the higher the aerobic running proportion, with greater emphasis on injury prevention to improve attendance. However, this isn't mandatory—you can determine training ratios based on your own understanding. If you don't want to do intervals, setting them to 0 is perfectly acceptable.

Wishing everyone great running success and healthy hexagon filling!
