A few years ago, when I was looking for a training plan for the Guangzhou Marathon, I discovered the Hanson Marathon Method. What attracted me most at the time was that the longest distance in this plan was only 26 kilometers, instead of the traditional 32 kilometers. I also embraced its training philosophy: don't skip easy runs during the week, gradually accumulate fatigue, and simulate the feeling of the latter part of the marathon during weekend long runs.

After completing the entire plan (getting up before dawn) throughout the fall, I almost achieved personal bests in all distances from 5K to half marathon, but ultimately didn't get a marathon PB because there was no marathon in Guangzhou that year.

I believe this training method is very helpful for amateur runners who don't have coach guidance but desire systematic training, so I've digitized this classic training method to allow you to easily enjoy professional-level training guidance. Whether you're a marathon beginner or an experienced runner, this feature can provide you with appropriate training plans.

Detailed Configuration Steps

Step 1: Set Race Goals and Training Paces

First, set your race goal time, such as 3 hours 20 minutes. The system will automatically calculate paces for various training types based on your goal time:

Easy Run: 5'47" ~ 5'23" pace range for recovery and aerobic base training
LSD (Long Slow Distance): 5'11" steady pace to build endurance foundation
Tempo Run: 4'46" pace to improve lactate threshold
Strength Run: 4'40" pace to enhance muscle strength
Speed Endurance: 4'22" ~ 4'11" pace range to improve speed endurance

We provide both beginner and advanced training levels. The advanced plan will introduce interval training earlier and has relatively higher weekly mileage, suitable for runners with some training foundation.

You can also set the race date (such as January 18, 2026) and warm-up distance (such as 1.6 kilometers) and cool-down distance. These distances will be used in training sessions that require warm-up, specifically tempo runs, strength runs, and speed runs. In the Hanson training concept, warm-up and cool-down also contribute to the total mileage.

Step 2: Training Plan Overview

After clicking preview, we will display all training sessions in the entire plan for you in a list format. You can first get an overview and confirm whether the start time and race date are correct.

Step 3: Detailed Training Schedule

After clicking start, we will automatically insert all training sessions into your schedule. These schedules will automatically sync to Apple Watch, and you can follow the watch's guidance to complete each training session.

Step 4: Activity Tracking Calendar

The schedule list will track each training session just like regular training. For the Hanson plan, we have also created a specialized detailed plan view. On one hand, it allows you to review the paces for different running training sessions at any time, and on the other hand, it shows the overall training progress. Every time you complete a training session, it will be stamped on that day's training table, mainly for the joy of accomplishment.

PaceGuru's Hanson Marathon Plan configuration feature combines professional training concepts with streamlined configuration, providing you with a powerful and easy-to-use training tool. Through three simple configuration steps, you can get a customized training plan and steadily progress toward your marathon goals under scientific training guidance.

Whether your goal is to finish your first race or set a new personal best, this feature will become your capable assistant on your training journey. Of course, I hope you use my PaceGuru to execute this plan, but if you don't have an Apple Watch or don't like our design, we also have a web-based plan generator that you can try (https://www.paceguru.app/plans/hanson?lang=en)
